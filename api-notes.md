>should be able to list, create, view, update and delete habits via API.
-using insomnia to do these requests.
## by monday evening

Write up a list of endpoints you think you will need before you start doing this!
*list habits
*create a new habit
*view a habit
*update a habit
*delete a habit
*list records for a habit       
-(this should be on the habit detail API endpoint)
create a record for a habit for today (stretch: create a record for any date)
*update a record for a habit
*delete a record from a habit

### You should develop and test your endpoints using Insomnia. (You can also use the browsable API that DRF gives you in the browser, but you should be comfortable using Insomnia.)
